                                Hello, my name is Nathan Yee. I am a Sophomore at Dublin High School that is currently in the computer science pathway of the schoolâ€™s engineering academy. My interests are software engineering, UI design, and computer science. I am a SE 7 Java Certified Associate as well as and Autodesk Inventor Certified User.
                            </p>
                            <br/>
                            <p>
                                I am self-taught in Python, Java, HTML, CSS, SQL, and React. Whenever I find something interesting I would pursue it. My first experience with learning how to code was when I discovered how to make a website when I was 9, I learned new components by reading documentation on HTML. When I was 10, I self taught myself python and was able to transfer those skills to other languages such as java.
                            </p>
                            <br/>
                            <p>
                                Currently I am in the Principals of Engineering course offered by my school. The course is a  Project Lead The Way course. In my freshman year I completed the Introduction to Engineering and Design course.
                            </p>
                            <br/>
                            <p>
                                As of Fall 2018 I am also attending Las Positas for a Computer Science course, I plan to attend a UC after graduation so that I can study Computer Science, attending a UC would help build my knowledge of computers further than what I am already capable of so that I can know how to make applications that are far more functional and fast than what I can do now.
                            </p>
                            <br/>
                            <p>
                                I want to make the world better, faster, and safer with software. Software has increased global trade and connected people across the world. But technology is an ever evolving thing, and new innovations that make daily actions faster and more efficient are very exciting.
                            </p>
                            <br/>
