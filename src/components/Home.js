                                Hello, my name is Nathan Yee. I am a Junior at Dublin High School, and a student at Diablo Valley College and Las Positas College, and I am currently in the computer science pathway of the schoolâ€™s engineering academy. My interests are software engineering, UI design, and computer science. I am a SE 7 Java Certified Associate as well as and Autodesk Inventor Certified User.
                            </p>
                            <br/>
                            <p>
                                I am self-taught in Python, C++, Java, HTML, CSS, SQL, and React. Whenever I find something interesting I would pursue it. My first experience with learning how to code was when I discovered how to make a website when I was 9, I learned new components by reading documentation on HTML. When I was 10, I self taught myself python and was able to transfer those skills to other languages such as java.
                            </p>
                            <br/>
                            <p>
                                Currently I am in the Cybersecurity course offered by my school. The course is a  Project Lead The Way course. In my freshman year I completed the Introduction to Engineering and Design course - which taught CAD (Computer Aided Design). In my sophomore year I completed the Principles of Engineering course - which taught aspects of electrical and mechanical engineering as well as project management techniques.
                            </p>
                            <br/>
                            <p>
                                As of Fall 2018 I am also attending Las Positas College and Diablo Valley College for Computer Science courses, I plan to attend a UC after graduation so that I can study Computer Science, attending a UC would help build my knowledge of computers further than what I am already capable of so that I can know how to make applications that are more functional and more efficient.
                            </p>
                            <br/>
                            <p>
                                My goal is to take advantage of new and upcoming technologies to help create new technologies with a team of like minded people. Software has always been a great passion of mine and I would love to work with people who share the same passion and creativity.
                            </p>
                            <br/>
