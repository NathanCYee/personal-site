                                        Hello, my name is Nathan Yee. I am a Senior at Dublin High School, and a student
                                        at Diablo Valley College, Laney College, and Las Positas College, and I am
                                        currently in the computer science pathway of the schoolâ€™s engineering academy.
                                        My interests are software engineering, UI design, and computer science. I am a
                                        SE 7 Java Certified Associate as well as and Autodesk Inventor Certified User.
                                    </p>
                                    <br/>
                                    <p>
                                        I am proficient in Python, C++, Java, HTML, CSS, SQL, and React. Whenever I
                                        find something interesting I would pursue it. My first experience with learning
                                        how to code was when I discovered how to make a website when I was 9, I learned
                                        new components by reading documentation on HTML. When I was 10, I self taught
                                        myself python and was able to transfer those skills to other languages such as
                                        java.
                                    </p>
                                    <br/>
                                    <p>
                                        In my freshman year I completed the Introduction to Engineering and Design
                                        course - which taught CAD (Computer Aided Design). In my
                                        sophomore year I completed the Principles of Engineering course - which taught
                                        aspects of electrical and mechanical engineering as well as project management
                                        techniques. In my junior year I completed a PLTW Cybersecurity course which
                                        taught me the basics of cybersecurity, server configuration, and penetration
                                        testing.
                                    </p>
                                    <br/>
                                    <p>
                                        Since Fall 2018 I am also attending Diablo Valley College, Laney college, and
                                        Las Positas College for additional Computer Science courses. Currently I am
                                        studying computer science at DVC and Laney College. Through community college, I
                                        learned how to make iOS apps, work with databases, and understand Linux
                                        operating systems. In the fall of 2020 I studied data structures as well as SQL
                                        databases. Currently, I am studying low-level Assembly programming as well as
                                        the structure and interpretation of computer programs.

                                    <p>
                                        My goal is to take advantage of new and upcoming technologies to help create new
                                        technologies with a team of like minded people. Software has always been a great
                                        passion of mine and I would love to work with people who share the same passion
                                        and creativity.
                                    </p>
